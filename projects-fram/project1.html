                                            <h3>The Assignment</h3>
                                            <p>The first project was to create a HTML template to use for our website. The website should contain information about the construction of the website and a simple portfolio. The site should then be put on GitHub using Git bash with the link posted to the common area for the course. </p>
                                            <h3>Step 1 - Getting started</h3>
                                            <p>I decided that the most reasonable thing was to get all the necessary programs and accounts set up before trying to create the website. I therefore set up my account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, downloaded <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git bash</a> and as per the instructors reccommendation got <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, which was the HTML editor used for this project. </p>
                                            <h3>Step 2 - Templates</h3>
                                            <p>Since i didn't know anything about HTML i decided to use a template from <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up</a>. After a bit of looking around i found a template called <a href="https://html5up.net/dopetrope">Dopetrope</a>. It was clean looking and had some of the specific elements that i wanted, e.g., top bar with dropdown menu and an about section at the bottom of the page.   </p>
                                            <div>
                                                <img src="../images/dopetrope.jpg" style="width:75%"/>
                                            </div>
                                            <h3>Step 3 - Understanding HTML</h3>
                                            <p>As breifly mentioned before i had never worked with HTML. But similar to what I usually do I just started poking around. So I opened up Brackets, the HTML editor, uploaded the template and started to change values in the index.html file, commenting out lines and sometimes even removing them. I know, i'm a daredevil. Brackets has this handy feature that allows you to see the page in real time by pressing the horizontal lightning bolt in the top right corner. This feature opens up your web browser, in my case Google Chrome, and loads the page locally. That meant that I could use the inspect function in Chrome. By right-clicking the page and pressing inspect a side window pops up. </p>
                                                <div>
                                                <img src="../images/inspect.jpg" style="width:75%"/>
                                            </div>
                                            <p> This allows you to hover over individual lines of the HTML code and see what element of the page they correspond to.  Another benefit of this feature is that you can alter the code in the browser without it changing your .html file. So you can play around with the page withour it having any consequences.</p>
                                            <p>One of the things that I wish I had known sooner is that there are two main files, index.html and main.css. The code in the index.html file uses tags or predefined elements from the main.css file. E.g., &lt p &gt in the index.html file starts a paragraph but you would decide the size, color and font of that paragraph in the main.css file. You can even click the tag in the inspect window and see in what line they are in the main.css file, quite helpfull for me since i didn't write it.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Step 4 - Making it look good</h3>
                                            <p>After having gone through the code i removed, and added, some of the visual elements that i did not need. Removed big clickable icons from the home page, added tabs to the navigations bar and a page for my portfolio.</p>
                                            <p>A part of this step was of course also to fill the Poject 1 and portfolio pages with some usable information. </p>
                                            <h3>Step 5 - Loading...</h3>
                                            <p>Now that i had completed most of the things that i wanted to implement to the website I had to get it on to GitHub. After having followed the instructor video on how to use Git Bash i went over to GitHub and created my repository and made sure that it was set to public. After having created the repository I copied the code under "...or create a new repository on the command line". Next I headed to the folder containing my work, right-clicked on a blank space and pressed "Git Bash Here".</p>
                                            <div>
                                                <img src="../images/gitbash.jpg" style="width:75%"/>
                                            </div>
                                            <p>This opened up a terminal window directed to my folder. Pasted the code from before into the terminal and pressed enter. After having waited a bit and followed the on screen instructions on how to log in to GitHub through the terminal I went over to the Github page a saw that my files and folders were now in  <a href="https://github.com/kristobjarm/kristoferbjarmi"> my repository</a>. As per the instructions I then went into the settings tab, changed the source from None to Main and pressed save. This finally created a link to my finished GitHub <a href="https://kristobjarm.github.io/kristoferbjarmi/">website</a>.</p>
